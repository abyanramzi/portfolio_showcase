## 🧠 Machine Learning & Computer Vision Projects

### 🔹 [DETECTRON2 + SORT Tracking for Retail Product Counting](https://github.com/abyanramzi/detectron2-retail-product-counting.git)
It was developed as part of a **research and development initiative** to improve an existing client solution where **hand movements were mistakenly counted** as product transitions.
Two main results were achieved:

1. ✅ **Accurate counting** of retail products moving across the line.  
2. 🚫 **No false detection** for hand movements near the line.

### 🔹 [YOLOv7 + Thermal and RGB Camera for Poultry Counting and Classification](https://github.com/abyanramzi/yolov7-thermal-rgb-bird-detection.git)
This research focusing on **number of birds** and their **species identification**. We adopt **YOLOv7**, that integrated to two types of cameras:
- **RGB Camera** — captures standard visual images.
- **Thermal Camera** — provides infrared imaging for detection in challenging lighting conditions.  
We introduce a **cage contour measurement technique**, which classifies cages based on the percentage of obstacles (from least to most obstructed). The performance of the detection model is then compared across both camera types under varying cage conditions.  
The two prediction results below illustrate different conditions captured by the RGB and Thermal cameras.  
- **RGB Prediction**: Actual condition includes 4 quails, 1 pigeon, and 5 lovebirds.  
- **Thermal Prediction**: Actual condition includes 8 quails.

## 📊 Data Analysis Projects

### 🔹 [Fraud Detection](https://github.com/abyanramzi/bank-transaction-fraud-detection.git)
The study case focuses on how transaction frequency, amount, and behavioral signals (such as login attempts) can indicate unusual or high-risk activity. My aims to **detect potential fraudulent banking transactions** by analyzing customer behavioral patterns using **unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering)**

| Description | Preview |
